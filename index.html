    <p>I like Banana Bread because it's simple to make and it's <em>delicious</em> as well as healthy.<br>
        
        Even though some banana breads are high in sugar, fat, and overall calories, most banana breads serve as a<mark> good source of key vitamins and minerals.</mark> For example, bananas are rich in potassium and vitamin B6. Banana bread made with these fruits contains a good amount of these nutrients.<br>

        Banana bread is also undoubtedly a <b>comfort food</b> — according to Spiers, "probably... ... because it's sweet. " Its comfort factor may also lie in the fact that it's also something that many associate with childhood.<br>
        Watching dough rise and shapeshift triggers pleasure centres in the brain, while the smell of freshly baked bread instigates a Pavlovian response through “odour-cued memories,” according to food scientists at University College Dublin's Institute of Food and Health, sparking familiar, cozy feelings from childhood.</p>
